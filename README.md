# 42-Lisbon-Common-Core-Libft_Enhanced

This project is an evolving library of custom C functions, originally based on the 42 Libft project. It features re-implementations of various standard C library functions (e.g., `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_strdup`) and an expanding collection of non-standard utility functions.

The initial goal was to deeply understand the inner workings of these fundamental functions and to master memory management in C. As I've progressed through subsequent projects, this library has been continuously enhanced. Existing functions have been refined, and new functions, tailored to the needs of those projects, have been integrated.

Libft Enhanced serves as a personal, robust toolkit and a foundational C library that will continue to grow and adapt throughout my coding journey. It reflects an ongoing commitment to building efficient and reliable C utilities.
